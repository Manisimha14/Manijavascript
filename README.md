Core Concepts
Each directory in this repository focuses on a specific JavaScript concept. Here's a quick overview of what you'll find:

01-variables-and-data-types/: Learn about var, let, const, and the different data types like string, number, boolean, object, and array.
Coming Soon

02-operators-and-expressions/: Understand arithmetic, comparison, logical, and assignment operators.

03-control-flow/: Master if/else, switch statements, for loops, while loops, and do/while loops.

04-functions/: Dive into function declarations, expressions, arrow functions, and the this keyword.

05-objects/: Explore object literals, constructors, prototypes, and the basics of object-oriented programming.

06-arrays/: Work with array methods like map(), filter(), reduce(), and more.

07-asynchronous-js/: Get a grip on asynchronous JavaScript with callbacks, Promises, async/await, and the event loop.

Each topic directory includes commented code examples and a brief explanation of the key concepts.

Best Practices
This repository isn't just about syntax; it's about learning to write clean, maintainable, and professional code. Throughout the examples, you'll find adherence to industry standards, including:

ESLint and Prettier: Code formatted to a consistent standard.

Clear Variable Naming: Using descriptive and semantic names.

Modularity: Breaking down complex problems into smaller, manageable functions.

Documentation: In-line comments and clear file structure to explain the "why" behind the code.
