// how memory works in java script
// stack and heap memory
// primitive types are stored in stack memory
// non primitive types are stored in heap memory
// stack is used for reference variable and heap is used to store the value or object of the reference variable
// in memory the reference variable is matche with the value or object in heap memory
// multiple reference variables can point to the same object in heap memory
